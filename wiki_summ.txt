title: Unique identifier,
 text: A unique identifier (UID) is an identifier that is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for those objects and for a specific purpose. 
The concept  was formalized early in the development of computer science and information systems. 
In general, it was associated with an atomic data type. 
In relational databases, certain attributes of an entity that serve as unique identifiers are called primary keys. 
In mathematics, set theory uses the concept of element indices as unique identifiers. 
There are some main types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different generation strategy:. 
The above methods can be combined, hierarchically or singly, to create other generation schemes which guarantee uniqueness. 
In many cases, a single object may have more than one unique identifier, each of which identifies it for a different purpose. 
National identification number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governance-related functions.,

 There are different types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different generation strategy, and they can be combined in various ways to create other generation schemes that guarantee uniqueness 
 Additionally, a single object can have multiple unique identifiers for different purposes 
 National identification numbers are used by governments as a means of tracking their citizens and residents for various functions such as work, taxation, health care, and governance-related functions
